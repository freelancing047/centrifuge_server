2.DEFINITIONS. The following terms have the meanings assigned to the below:

"Derivative Software" means the Binary code Software and/or Binary code that results from your compilation of modified or unmodified source code Software. Derivative Software may not include Early Access Release Materials or Internal Tools.

"Developer Product" means Your own computer product that incorporates Derivative Software and does not substantially duplicate the capabilities or compete with the Derivative Software or the Software.

"Internal Tools" means compatibility criteria, test suites, test tools, end user products, and other programs designed to aid in the development of, but not be incorporated in, Derivative Software Products.


3.LICENSES. Use of the Software and Documentation is subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement. The Software contains various software programs with different license rights. Novell grants You the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to: a) internally use the Early Access Release Materials and Internal Tools in support of Your efforts to develop Derivative Software hereunder (but You may not include any portion of Early Access Release Materials or Internal Tools in Derivative Software); b) use, modify, and compile source code Software for the purpose of creating Developer Products, if the source code Software is identified as licensed for use in creating Developer Products; and, c) reproduce and distribute Derivative Software as part of a Developer Product.

Additional License Grants. Sample source code or other files that are made available as part of the Software may include a license grant that is broader then the license granted above in 3. If so, while Your use of such files is governed by the terms of this Novell Developer License Agreement, the license grants for such files are as described in the license language included with the files.

Open Source Software. Your license to use software that is provided subject to a separate open source license is described in and subject to the license agreement included with the software.

Third Party Products. As a service to You, certain third party software products may be made available to You from Novell. Your license to use such products is as described in and subject to the license agreement provided by the third party.

4.RESTRICTED SOFTWARE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, portions of the Software and/or Documentation may be subject to restrictions set forth in terms that accompany those portions. You agree to abide by such restrictions. If such restrictions are unacceptable to You, You may not use the Software.

5.RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Novell reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing You: a) acknowledge that the source code of the binary code Software represents and embodies trade secrets of Novell or its licensors (except for source code made publicly available by the licensor); b) agree not to disassemble, decompile, or otherwise reverse engineer the binary code Software to discover the source code and/or trade secrets embodied in the source code; c) acknowledge that Novell has not authorized You to rent, lease, and/or time share the Software; and, d) while certain test tools and test suites may be provided, YOU AGREE THAT ONLY NOVELL CAN ISSUE AND PUBLISH TEST BULLETINS OR AUTHORIZE USE OF THE "YES" OR OTHER NOVELL LOGOS.

6.EARLY ACCESS MATERIALS. Novell does not represent or warrant that it will make the Early Access Materials generally available to the public or that any target dates will be met. Novell may change or cancel its plans at any time.

9.AUDIT. Upon reasonable notice, Novell may at its own expense audit your site(s) to ensure compliance with this Agreement. Novell will notify you in writing of any deficiency in compliance and will provide a recommended plan for resolving outstanding issues. Your failure to cure such deficiencies within 30 days after receipt of the written notification will constitute a material breach and will be grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement.

10.DEVELOPER INDEMNIFICATION. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Novell harmless from all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by Novell as a result of any claim, or judgment against Novell by any third party arising out of, or connected in any manner with, distribution or use of software created by You through the use of Software licensed to You under this Agreement or arising out of breach of this Agreement.
