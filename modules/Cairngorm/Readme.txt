This module is used to create Cairngorm.swc.  

This is version 2.2.1 of the Cairngorm framework; it was downloaded from

    http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/cairngorm/Downloads


To build the SWC, cd into this directory and enter the command "ant'.

The SWC file will be written to directory "bin".

You can also use FlexBuilder to create a SWC; there are project config files in this source.

The exported, visible classes of the SWC are defined in file cairngorm-manifest.xml (for ant builds)
and .flexLibProperties (for FlexBuilder builds).
